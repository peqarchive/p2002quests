Alas, this windmill requires constant upkeep due the constant surge of power that it propels. The gears are constantly getting sandy and the axles lose their grease almost daily.

Also, tri-platinum foil and mini-gyro shields would be good for something or another. Micro-ceramic sleeves are a nice find as well. Got all that? Now, reach around up there in the area of the transcentrifugal axle that isn't working. You'll either be badly wounded or transported to the Plane of Innovation. Take care!");
