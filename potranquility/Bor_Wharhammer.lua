T'be 'onest, at times I do miss the old forge, but after I created me finest breastplate, it seemed as if nothing else I made could ever live up t'it.  So I left me home to'wander the land an' see what I could learn o'the world.  I 'ave learned quite a bit from the elders 'ere an' the skilled craftspeople in New Tanaan.  I 'ave even devised a [" .. eq.say_link("what emblem?",false,"type o'emblem") ..

They allow a planes traveler with no craftin' skills t'create many fine pieces o'planar armor in a special, magical kit I also 'ave an' will throw in with the price. The kit acts as a focal point fer the wild magic energy o'the Planes. Ye will only be able t'use each emblem an' kit once when ye create the piece, 'owever I dinnae be goin' anywhere soon!

Anyone who ventures far into the planes finds that they must wear excellent armor t'protect them from the savage environment.  The very essence of planar energy can be focused into a form that can fit our shape.  As ye progress deeper into the planes, ye will find many molds an' patterns with which t'base a set o'armor.

Ethereal metal ring construction is another matter. Ye will need to combine a brick o'ethereal energy, an ethereal temper an' a file within a Tanaan forge.
