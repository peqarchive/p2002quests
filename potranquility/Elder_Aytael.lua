He was the first to give mortals a true sense of our real power. The unfathomable concept that a mortal could gain an understanding of the immortal realms was wholly new and beyond the grasp of most. Those that did gain an understanding of Zebuxoruk’s teachings rose in power. Though, [" .. eq.say_link("others") ..

Their power-crazed nature led to the misuse of Zebuxoruk’s gift of insight and it drove them mad as a race. Their egotistical nature was a their curse and it attracted the attention of the elder gods. The Sebilisian history is full of stories of such power, both positive and negative. There are many key examples in Kunark’s history that can assist in the understanding of the balance. The knowledge that mortals wield can build [" .. eq.say_link("empires") ..

There are many stories that describe his capture by the elder gods and their punishment. Until recently, we have not been able to completely decipher the truth. That is what we have been working on. Our people have been opening [" .. eq.say_link("portals") .. "] for ages, in the hopes of finding more information about Zebuxoruk’s fate.");

Naturally, curiosity and lust for power drove other mortals in to the Planes. The defilement of these sacred territories led the pantheon to feel even more justified in their persecution of Zebuxoruk and his followers. It set the momentum that brought us to this place and time. Now, you have found his location for us. We wait only on your final incursions into the elemental Planes, the true Planes of Power. Then we will move through time to finally find the answers that have been waiting for us for so long.")
