And so he took thirty volunteers and led them in a suicide ambush to halt the giants' chase while the rest of our people got away. Without his sacrifice, the Coldain might very well have been wiped out that day. Once we were safe, scouts were dispatched to the battle with the hope of finding survivors. Amidst the field of bodies they found this crown, axe, and breastplate which belonged to our beloved leader. Of Colin's actual body, no remnant was ever found.");
