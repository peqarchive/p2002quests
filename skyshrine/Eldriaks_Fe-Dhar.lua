				e.self:Say("Good. The weapon is extremely complicated to construct, your skills will be tested perhaps beyond your abilities. The weapon is known as a Naginata. You need not be proficient in its use to build it. The Naginata is constructed of four major parts. [" .. eq.say_link("The shaft") .. "], [the blade], [the fittings], and [the hilt], or tsuba. No ordinary materials can hope to bind the dragons spirit. Special materials must be found.");
			elseif(e.message:findi("the shaft")) then
				e.self:Say("The shaft must be strong enough to withstand the effects of the spirit's presence, yet flexible enough to be wielded properly. Of the few dragons that returned to us from the Ring of Scale, some brought back knowledge of a type of wood that may be sufficient. It is known as bronzewood. One can find it amidst one of the forests on the continent of Kunark. I am sure it is being used by one of the sentient races there.");
			elseif(e.message:findi("the fittings")) then
				e.self:Say("The fittings are the most important part. The spirit itself will be held there partially. We'll discuss this later, when you have all the other pieces in your possesion.");
			elseif(e.message:findi("the hilt")) then
				e.self:Say("The Tsuba is where most of the enchantment will lie. It must be forged seperately of another ore created to be the bane of the dragon. It is called [" .. eq.say_link("chronium") .. "] and was developed by the Kromzek with the aid of their blood-thirsty @#%$. You must forge the ore into a plate and then find a [craftsman] with the skill to carve a detailed mandala of draconic binding into it. This mandala will hold arcane power and restrain the spirit from destroying the weapon.");
			elseif(e.message:findi("chronium")) then
				e.self:Say("Chronium is a sacred ore used only by the higher ranked priests of Rallos Zek. You may be able to find some in the city of the Kromzek, Kael Drakkel. Perhaps in one of their temples. Forging it into a plate is simple. Heat the ore in a forge and shape it with a Forging Hammer, then temper it with a Flask of Water. ");
			elseif(e.message:findi("the blade")) then
				e.self:Say("The blade will be the most difficult piece for you to build. First of all, no mundane ore will do. Long ago, Veeshan sent a gift to us in the form of a meteor. This meteor holds the ore you must build the blade with. Once you have the ore, follow the instructions in this book and forge the blade. Don't forget, when melting the ore, use the bone dust I gave you.");
			elseif(e.message:findi("craftsman")) then
				e.self:Say("Since the [" .. eq.say_link("mandala") .. "] is so detailed, only a craftsman trained specifically in these matters will do. I'm sure you're a fine smith but an adventurer like yourself wouldn't have time to fully master the skill needed to create the tsuba. Find one whose entire life is the art of creating these types of weapons. The craftsman will need a sketch of the mandala as well as the plate of chronium.");
			elseif(e.message:findi("mandala")) then
				e.self:Say("The type of mandala we need is a diagram laced with powerful arcane enchantment. You'll need to find a sketch of the correct mandala for the craftsman to go by as he carves it into the chronium plate. There is one [" .. eq.say_link("place") .. "] you may be able to find a sketch of a mandala powerful enough to bind Garzicor.");
			elseif(e.message:findi("place")) then
				e.self:Say("The ones that returned to us from the Ring of Scale told us of the Sarnak. These are hybrids of dragons and a sentient lizard race known as the Iksar. Whoever created them had to bind a dragon to his will or restrain it at some point. Perhaps this being or one of his brood still has a recording of the mandala. Once you have the Tsuba, Blade, and Shaft, return here and show them to me. I will then explain what must be done next.")

				e.self:Say("First you must awaken his spirit by speaking where you found his corpse. You must say exactly this: 'You are one but two. Your vengeance shall find a home.' Hopefully this will bring him to you. You must hurry and splash the vial of Kromzek blood upon his ghostly form. The taste of the blood will bring him fully into existence. You must then do battle with him. If you defeat him, you will have split his being which will be represented by two more shades. Give them each a flawless diamond. He will comply and choose these gems as a phylactery. Once you have the dual phylactery, you need only combine them with the assembled naginata in a forge to create the Ethereal Bladed Naginata.
