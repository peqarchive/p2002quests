They paid close attention to the things the dragons avoided... certain plants and watering holes. It was determined that a particular type of [plant], when mixed with other reagents, was deadly to the dragons. The giants adapted their technique to specifically harm Yelinaks brood in order to give them an advantage. The ancient Kromzek king, Porlos, used this to aid in his battle with Hsagra, Yelinaks mate. Porlos killed Hsagra, forever bringing Yelinaks vengeance upon his family. Thus began the eternal war between the giants and the dragons.");
