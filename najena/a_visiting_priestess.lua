The giants were flung across the face of Norrath like seeds to the wind. The Ankexfen's fates were more severe. The entire race was exterminated, but from the ashes were born the four goblin races. What is known is that each goblin clan was stripped of any knowledge and was neither informed of the other clans nor of their own origins. Each clan was then transported to a separate environment to help preserve the gods' will. However, the gods were not without mercy and each clan was granted a section of the staff. Upon each staff, a crystal was placed. These staves served to aid the goblin clans in understanding their environments. These remnants of the staff of Ankexfen are what I desire. Bring them to me and the Priests of Innoruuk shall reward you.");
