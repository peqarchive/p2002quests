We have all spent much time preparing for your arrival and hope that our time is not in vain. If you are a wielder of the elemental forces, then come and browse my inventory, friend! I may hold a spell or two that might pique your interest. Also, if you perhaps hold a seemingly mundane item of arcane relation that you found in your travels upon the planes, then do not hesitate to let me have a look at it. Don't worry -- we are not thieves here! Rather, we wish to aid you and I so love dabbling in the chaos of planar magic!");
