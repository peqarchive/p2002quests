All citizens of New Tanaan have come together in welcoming Norrath's curious travelers who crave knowledge and a path to better themselves individually. What little help I alone can offer is extended to the Beastlords of Norrath, for as I was once one of them in a time long since past. If you are a Beastlord, then perhaps what spells that I have penned, though neither unique nor rare to your world, would be of use. If through your endeavors upon the planes you happen to come across fledgling manuscripts -- similar to those upon which a spell or song is scribed -- then you may return them to me if you wish. I am quite versed in the ways of planar magics relating to the Beastlord's focus.");
